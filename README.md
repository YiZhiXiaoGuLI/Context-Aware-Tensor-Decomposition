Description
--------
1. File folder TensorData encloses the text files of features extracted from original datasets.
2. TransformTxt2Mat.m reads the text files and transforms them by normalization. The results
are saved as .mat files enclosed in TensorMat file folder.
3. TensorForExperiment.m runs tensor decomposition (TD) with four different settings: (1) TD
without features, (2) TD plus spatial feature extracted POIs and road networks (TD+B), (3)
TD+B plus check-in feature (TD+B+D), and (4) TD+B+D plus the feature of noise category
correlations (TD+B+C+D). To evaluate the performance, we randomly choose 70% data as
train data and other 30% data as test data. The error metrics of the results of TD are RMSE
and MAE.
4. TensorForDemo.m obtains the result of tensor decomposition with all three features without
choosing 70% data as train data. The result is stored in .mat files, in folder TensorResult.
